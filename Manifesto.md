### **Manifesto of Entre: A Revolution for Entrepreneurs and Visionaries**

**Dedicated to My Hero, Ross Ulbricht, My Little Brother, and the Inspiring Philosophy of Naval Ravikant**\
This manifesto is for those whose lives were taken too soon, for those who dreamed of a better world, and for those who continue to light the way forward.

It is for the unsung heroes—the ones who sit in silence, unnoticed, with minds capable of shaping the future.

It is for the **little guy** with code that could move mountains but no platform to stand on.\
It is for the **entrepreneurs** who haven't yet made it but dare to dream.\
It is for the **brilliant minds** who brought us Bitcoin, decentralization, and the idea that freedom and opportunity can be coded into existence.

And it is for **Naval Ravikant**, whose wisdom and philosophy inspire us to think deeply, act boldly, and live meaningfully. Naval reminds us to embrace rational optimism, take accountability, and create a world where kindness, intelligence, and action are the currencies of success.

### **Entre: A Platform for All**

Entre is more than a coin or a marketplace—it is a **movement** rooted in the Latin meaning of entrepreneurship: **“to swim out with the intent to gain knowledge.”**

Entre is for those who swim out into the unknown, not for personal gain alone but for the purpose of **creating, contributing, and giving back to the world**.

Entre embodies inclusivity at a global scale. Its design ensures that everyone in the world has the opportunity to earn a piece of it. Its vision aligns with the current and future population, ensuring accessibility for all today and for generations to come.

### **A Vision Rooted in Humanity**

Entre Coin begins with a total supply of **8.09 billion tokens**, one for every human alive today. This foundational supply is not merely a number—it is a promise. Every individual, no matter where they are, will have the opportunity to earn their share by contributing to the ecosystem, creating value, and participating in the global community.

As the world population grows, so too will the supply of Entre Coin. Through a process of **purposeful mining**, additional tokens will be released at a rate aligned with population growth, ensuring that every new soul on Earth has the same opportunity to participate, earn, and contribute.

### **Mining Human Potential**

Entre Coin is a currency designed to reward **action, contribution, and kindness**. Like Bitcoin miners solving blocks, participants in Entre mine value through their efforts to build a better world.

#### **How Entre Coin Works:**

1. **Rewarding Impact:**

   - Save a failing business? Earn Entre Coin proportional to the value of your contribution to the world.
   - Offer your expertise or do pro bono work? Entre Coin recognizes and rewards your altruism.

2. **Mining Through Action:**

   - Completing tasks, solving problems, and creating opportunities “mines” Entre Coin.
   - It’s not just about financial transactions—it’s about building, solving, and helping.

3. **Population Growth Mining:**

   - As the global population increases, new tokens are mined at the same rate, ensuring that the supply remains inclusive.
   - This creates a system that adapts with humanity, reflecting the value of people and their potential.

4. **A System of Merit:**

   - Rewards are tied to measurable impact, not empty promises. The more you contribute to others’ success, the more you gain.

### **Entre: A Platform for the World**

#### **For the Little Guy**

Entre gives the unnoticed a chance to shine. The coder in a small town, the marketer with untapped genius, the entrepreneur with untested ideas—all are welcome.

#### **For the Big Guy**

Entre connects global visionaries with the talent, trust, and transparency they need to grow, creating partnerships across borders and industries.

#### **For the Struggling**

Entre becomes a lifeline. A business on the brink can find help, and those who save it are celebrated and rewarded.

### **A Culture of Trust and Collaboration**

1. **Open-Source Revolution**

   - Entre belongs to everyone. Its code, its coin, and its mission are open for the world to see, contribute to, and improve.

2. **Decentralized Collaboration**

   - No one owns Entre; the community governs it. Decisions are made transparently, with Entre Coin holders guiding its future.

3. **Kindness Is Currency**

   - Acts of kindness and selflessness are as valuable as financial transactions. Entre Coin rewards both equally.

### **Time Is the Most Precious Resource**

Entre recognizes that **time is finite**, and wasting it is the death of opportunity. Entrepreneurs on this platform will be encouraged to operate with efficiency and intention:

- **Eliminate Distractions:** Focus only on the highest-impact tasks. Cut unnecessary meetings, emails, and busy work.
- **Action Bias:** The best way to determine if something works is to do it. Entre rewards those who act decisively and learn from experience.
- **Value Creation Over Activity:** Busy calendars do not equal meaningful progress. Entre values outcomes, not optics.

---

### **Accountability Equals Equity**

When you take accountability, you take equity in your work. You bear both the risks and the rewards, with Entre Coin serving as the ultimate reflection of this philosophy.

- **Risk with Integrity:** Entre recognizes those who take risks in good faith. Failures are forgiven when efforts are genuine and high-integrity.
- **Unlimited Upside:** Those who take greater accountability and action are rewarded with greater equity—an upside proportional to their impact.

---

### **Our Call to Action**

This is your invitation to **swim out into the unknown** and create something extraordinary. Entre isn’t just a platform or a coin—it’s a **global revolution** built by the many for the many.

Whether you’re a coder in a small apartment, an entrepreneur chasing a dream, or a visionary ready to change the world—Entre is yours.

---

### **The Legacy of Entre**

This is for those who swim out when others hold back.\
This is for those who see opportunity in every failure.\
This is for the visionaries who believe the world can be better, fairer, and more connected.

Together, we will decentralize growth, democratize opportunity, and reward kindness and impact.

Entre is more than a name—it’s a way of life.

Let’s swim out, together.

**With gratitude and determination,**\
**EntrePrende**
